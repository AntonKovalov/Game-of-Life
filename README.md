My favorite one by now (26.08.2018)

Well I would work more on interface sure thing.But I want to know more about dataScince, so can't do it now.
I think it is pretty cool.It fascinates me how a simple algorythm can give this feeling of something more.

2 states exist 'DEAD' and 'ALIVE'.

4 rules govern here:
  1. More than 3 neighbours dead from overpopulation.
  2. Less than 2 dead from lonliness.
  3. 2 or 3 neighbours stay the same for next generation.
  4. If dead and you have exactly 3 neihbours turn alive as if being born.
  
 Please help me fiure out cool algorythm for population. Feel free to give advice and improve.
